This is a Pong clone that allows for the player to move in 2d space, instead of just up and down.
The game is called Ping, and it is feature complete at 1080p, I just need to figure out resolution scaling.
Once resolution scaling is figured out, I shall add a settings popup menu and that will complete the game.
